Solution:

The error message indicates that you are trying to run a script in PowerShell, but your system's execution policy is preventing it. Execution policies are a security feature of PowerShell that control whether scripts can be run on the system.
To fix this issue, you need to change the execution policy on your system. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator by searching for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as administrator".
2. Type the following command and press Enter: Get-ExecutionPolicy
3. If the policy is set to "Restricted", then PowerShell will not allow any scripts to run. To change the policy, type the following command and press Enter: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
4. You will be prompted to confirm the change. Type "Y" and press Enter.
5. Now, try running the script again. It should work without any issues.

Note that changing the execution policy on your system can be a security risk, so you should only do this if you trust the script that you are trying to run. After you have finished running the script, you should set the execution policy back to its original setting.
