List of suggestions/comments:

- User error in transcription is ok

- Why transcribe audio if user uploads text

- Why user needs to upload/type text if there is a transcription

- Why correct grammar before rating(makes user grammar have high rating)

- Rate the raw grammar of the speech(improvement would be gradually observed)

- In objectives it should be:
#1 Transcribe audio, #2 (Will be the #3), #3 (Will be the #2), #4 retain, #5 retain.

- Upload text is only an option

- Add in scope the conversion of audio to text

- Scope should be based on the 5 objectives (set 1 for each)

- Input of audio and text file is part of scope

- Delimitation is, other form of input is not accepted except for audio.

- Delimitation is lumped into one

- What if the speech is monotone? Try if the app can determine monotone.

- Limitation, not go into topic of the speech itself.

- How long does a 5 minute audio process (verify by trying a maximum 5 minute audio)

- Concern of Feature Driven Development is that after 1 feature is done, the product can be released

- Possible answer for the thesis about FDD is that the objectives are individual/independent variables and aren't interconnected to each other.
